# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project implements a **Machine Learning classification model** to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical characteristics such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The application demonstrates a complete ML workflow including data handling, model training, and prediction, with a simple app-based interface for interaction.

## Project Objective

To classify Iris flowers into one of the following three species:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica  

using supervised machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

- **File:** `iris-species.csv`
- The dataset contains measurements of 150 Iris flowers.
- Features used:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Target variable:
  - Species
